        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there, I'm so glad you made it to my page! Welcome!<br>
            I'm Siret, screenname 'Evergreen Lilac'. "Why 'Evergreen Lilac'?" I hear you ask. Well, let me explain.
            'Siret' is derived from 'Sirel' which means 'Lilac' in Estonian and 'Evergreen' was inspired by a sight I once encountered in spring:
            a green lilac bush covered in snow, thriving despite the cold.<br>

            I'm an aspiring frontend developer/artist currently residing in Estonia with my significant other and our little rascal Shiba Inu Miko.
            This page is meant to be a testament to my ever-improving skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I really hope you like what you see.<br>

            Some trivial information about me:
            <ul>
                <li>I'm a sucker for time travel sci-fi, my favorite is Doctor Who.</li>
                <li>I don't smoke or drink coffee, energy drinks or alcohol. 
                    Instead, I find relief and strength in the likes of chocolate (nothing above 40% though!) and a nice cup of tea.</li>
                <li>I'm what some might call a 'casual gamer'. I like to unwind at the end of the day with a few hours of a game I'm obsessed with at that given time.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
