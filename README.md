# Portfolio page

Static site built with vanilla HTML, CSS & JS, featuring sweet vanilla web components, fun keyframe animations and lots of lilacs. All image assets (aside from the photograph of me) were drawn by me.

Upcoming features include:

-   an est/eng language switcher
-   a light/dark theme switcher
-   an option to pause all animations
-   artwork display
-   and more!

Also have a look at the relevant [figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/qWZ5w6Fu4sDudUDlGrix9V/Portfolio-project?node-id=410-5&t=sAtB4I0ZTbEJIVpU-1) to see this site's design progress through time. Because I am primarily a developer, not UX designer, the final Figma isn't 100% the same as the coded end result; I found it easier to make tweaks through CSS than to rework the design file.
