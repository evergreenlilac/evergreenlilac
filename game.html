                    <p>This is a point and click, choose your own adventure game, 
                    set in a fantasy world that resembles planet Earth in the 1700s AD, but werewolves, vampires, mages and alike are in fact real,
                    though they are an underground minority who must hide their true selves to avoid execution, because most commonfolk are in truth terrified of them.<br><br>

                    You can choose to be fantastical or mundane, cruel or kind, for or against the hunt. Your journey is yours to choose.<br><br>
                
                    This is... a <b>big</b> project for me and will likely take a long time to fully finish. Currently what you can play is largely just bare bones,
                    just a few minutes of content really, but I wanted to get it out there so I could get player feedback early on. 
                    Any thoughts you have to share are greatly appreciated. Contact me via email: sireteller@gmail.com or Discord: EvergreenLilac#0424 to start a conversation.</p>

                <div class="doge-intro">
                    <h2>Where's Miko?</h2>

                    <p>Alternatively, you could play this little Where's Waldo type game, but instead of Waldo, you have to find Miko the Shiba, hidden in the picture. 5 levels.
                        Click on him to win. Easy as that.<br><br>
                    </p>
